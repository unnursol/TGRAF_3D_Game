### Models
We learned some basic modeling techniques in blender and were able to put together the **Globe** with multiple diffuse material and stripes to mark between the road-lanes. And we made the **heart** ourselves as well.
Other models are found online, mostly at free3d.com, imported into blender, color customized and exported using the g3dj exporter.
